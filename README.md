# Olatunji Oduola

I am an energetic, compassionate and people focused **Junior Software Engineer**, who has spent the last 6 years working in London's recruitment sector. As scary as it once was, picking up the phone to speak with complete strangers, I have greatly enjoyed connecting with people from all backgrounds and fine tuning my soft skills along the way.

Graduating with a Chemical Engineering degree from the University of Birmingham I am natuarally inquisitive and analytical in my thinking.
